# Village_Defense_2.0

Project depends on the GameAPI (https://github.com/TomTheCreator/GameAPI) which is 4 year old. 
This project is build 2 years ago and is very very messy after all those bugfixes. If want to adjust something in it but can't figure stuff out, just contact me and I'll point you in the right direction.
I don't like the code and neither will you. Goodluck!

Pull requests will be reviewed although if I don't respond within 1-2 days, please PM me at SpigotMC
